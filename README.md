# pixel platformer
Pixel-platformer is an unnamed game project revolving around 2d platforming made with Unity. This project is in an extremely early development phase and is not able to be installed at the moment. To view the game you will need to run the project in Unity. We are working on this project whenever we have time and are not working on school.
