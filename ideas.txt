General game mechanic ideas:
    - player can control companion to enter areas inaccesible otherwise
    - have area that is completly dark and companion lights it up

Things we need:
 - novelity 
- pacing (not one gameplay style the entire game)
- mystery
- challenge
- anticipation
- goals
- positive feedback loop (progression)
-
